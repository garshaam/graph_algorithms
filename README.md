# graph_algorithms
Contains implementations of basic graph algorithms that I learned through the math directed reading program at Texas A&amp;M University.
I learned more algorithms than those contained here; this was just an exercise in implementing some low level pseudocode.

I learned later on that the boost c++ library has better representations of graphs. If I were to continue studying graph theory I would start by building upon boost or another libary.

## Background
I participated in the math directed reading program for the spring semester of 2023. My mentor, Kanan Gupta, helped me learn about graph theory with a rigorous mathematical basis.
On April 25th 2023 I presented on the maximum flow problem and various problems that can be reduced to maximum flow: https://www.overleaf.com/read/scqppsvsqtpv
