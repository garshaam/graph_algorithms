# graph_algorithms
Contains implementations of basic graph algorithms that I learned through the math directed reading program at Texas A&amp;M University.

##Background
I participated in the math directed reading program for the spring semester of 2023. My mentor, Kanan Gupta, helped me learn about these algorithms and more based on a rigorous mathematical basis.
